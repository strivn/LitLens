# LitLens Analysis Report

## Introduction

This report provides an analysis of the LitLens multi-agent research assistant system, examining agent interactions, protocol implementation, observed limitations, and potential improvements. LitLens demonstrates a practical application of multi-agent architectures for academic research assistance, utilizing specialized agents that operate asynchronously to deliver comprehensive research insights to users.

## Agent Interaction Analysis

### Cooperative Specialization Pattern

LitLens implements a cooperative specialization pattern where each agent has a distinct role within a research pipeline:

1. **SourceSeeker** acts as an orchestration agent, coordinating searches across multiple databases and handling result aggregation.

2. **ArXiv and Semantic Scholar Agents** function as specialized search agents, each tailored to a specific academic database's API and content structure. 

3. **InsightWeaver** serves as an analysis agent, processing the combined knowledge from source agents to generate synthesized insights.

This pattern provides several benefits:

- **Parallelization:** Multiple search operations execute concurrently, reducing total processing time
- **Modularity:** Each agent encapsulates specific knowledge or methods
- **Fault Tolerance:** Failure in one source agent doesn't prevent the system from returning partial results

## Protocol Implementation

### Model Context Protocol Integration

LitLens utilizes the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage communication between agents and integration with Claude Desktop. It allows LitLens to act as an extension to the MCP Client. 

## System Limitations and Improvement Ideas

LitLens is still very early and exhibits several limitations in its current implementation:

### 1. Query Understanding Limitations
LitLens capability to perform proper planning and generate multiple call to the search agents are still rather limited and is unable to perform queries for more complex research. The settings still need some adjustment too to make sure it is providing relevant papers to the query (e.g. "recent" research may be very different depending on what field and pace). 

Adding ReAct, Planning, or Iterative Workflow may help to improve this capability.

### 2. Robustness
There are still certain cases where the agent is generating queries that can't be searched through the APIs, or providing false output that can't be read by the MCP Client. 

Error handling should be enhanced. 

### 3. Explore other LLMs

Currently it is still using OpenAI Mini models variant. Further test with different LLMs may help to improve LitLens.
